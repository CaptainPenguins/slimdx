#summary SlimDX -- September 2008 Release
= Introduction =

The September 2008 release of SlimDX is now out! This release, like the previous one, is not a beta but a fully stable self contained package that installs all of the necessary prerequisites. This release includes support for Direct3D 9Ex and DirectSound, as well as enhanced debugging support, a new Sample Framework, and many more enhancements and bug fixes.

If you're new to this whole thing, read the [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started Getting Started] document on our wiki. It should help get you moving. Other pages of interest include:

= Files to Download =
The following packages are available to download:

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20%28September%202008%29.exe SlimDX Installer] -- *Recommended for all developers and end users!* This installer contains everything you need to run and develop SlimDX applications, including the prerequisite DirectX and Visual C++ libraries.

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20x64%20%28September%202008%29.exe SlimDX Installer for x64] -- Same as the above, but contains 64 bit versions of everything. Only download this if you are using Windows XP 64 bit or Windows Vista 64 bit, and wish to develop 64 bit applications.

SlimDX Samples -- Archive of all our available samples, with source code. Currently contains 11 samples across Direct3D9, Direct3D10, DirectInupt, RawInput, and XAudio2. Also includes our SampleFramework, used to easily and quickly build SlimDX applications based on Direct3D9 without having to worry about boilerplate details. _Samples are only built as 32 bit currently._
  _Due to exhausting our Google Code quota, the up to date samples package is currently unavailable. We have submitted a request for more space and will upload the latest samples package as soon as possible. The [http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20Samples%20%28June%202008%29.zip June samples package] is still available._

[http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/latestdocs/Help/bin/SlimDX.chm Documentation] -- In CHM format. Our official class reference documentation. Note that this documentation is also available [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/latestdocs/ online].

SlimDX Binaries -- _Advanced users only._ If for some reason you don't want to use the installer, this ZIP archive contains the SlimDX binaries for x86 and x64. Not recommended for most people.
  _Also unavailable due to our quota issues._

[http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/downloads/list?can=1 Older files] are still available, in case you have some need for them.

= Remarks =
The September release of SlimDX is a somewhat incremental improvement over the June release, as we strive to improve the overall library quality. After several requests from users, we added support for both DirectSound and Direct3D 9Ex. Support for the latter is not currently at 100%, but it should be sufficient to cover the needs of nearly all users.

Apart from SlimDX itself, we've also been working to improve support for developers with an all new Sample Framework, and an Asteroids game that demonstrates how to use SlimDX in a practical way, rather than just in small samples. We hope to expand the library of sample games available, and would love help achieving that goal.

This installer also applies enhanced compression that has allowed us to significantly reduce the size of the redistributable package. In the case of the x86 version, the size was reduced by almost 30%, yielding an installer that is only 7.9 MB.

= Known Issues =
== 64 Bit Support ==
While 64 bit is now a completely supported configuration, there is a glitch in the installation package. Visual Studio users may not see SlimDX as a reference that can be added in the .NET tab of the Add Reference dialog. They will need to browse to the install location and add the reference that way. _This only affects developers._ Users will not see any difference, and the assembly is still properly registered in and referenced from the Global Assembly Cache.
== XInput Support ==
The installer does not bundle an XInput driver, as it's unclear exactly how Microsoft intends for this package to be redistributed. Testing of the downloadable driver showed that it consistently failed to install, so it was omitted. If you are using XInput, your users may need to visit Microsoft Update in order to get a functional driver for their controller.

= Communication =
There are several different ways to get in touch with the SlimDX team:
  * We suggest that questions be posted to the [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/forum.asp?forum_id=10 DirectX forum] on GameDev.Net, as all of the SlimDX developers are regulars there. You may at your discretion prefix your thread title with [SlimDX].
  * If you believe you have found a bug, or you have a feature request, please enter it on this site under the [http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/issues/list Issues tab].
  * The developers are also typically available in the #gamedev and #graphicsdev IRC channels on AfterNET (irc.afternet.org).
  * You can email the developer list, slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com. This is *not* a recommended method of communicating with us, but may be used as a last ditch effort.
If you're interested in working on SlimDX itself, we would be glad to have the help. Send a private message to [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/viewprofile.asp?ID=19810 Promit] on the GameDev.Net forums or email slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com if you want to contribute.
