#summary SlimDX -- June 2008 Release
= Introduction =

The June 2008 release of SlimDX is now out! As of this release, SlimDX is no longer considered beta software, but a fully stable library. It is now packaged as a redistributable installer which can be used by both developers and end users. SlimDX also finally officially supports 64 bit (x64) operating systems and code.

= Remarks =
The June release of SlimDX marks a major milestone for us, since it's no longer beta. In an effort to streamline and improve the experience for both users and developers, we've focused on two major projects that are not part of SlimDX itself:
  * [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/latestdocs/ Online Documentation] -- Online documentation was available before this release, but the documentation has been heavily worked on since, both in content and layout. The new version loads much quicker, and is far easier to navigate. ''We are aware of some minor rendering bugs in Firefox. If you know how to fix these, please contact us, because we have no idea how.''
  * Redistributable Installer -- Before this release, users and developers had to go out and get all the pieces that SlimDX depended on, which led to a lot of headaches in initial setup. The installer packages and installs SlimDX, a minimal subset of the DirectX redistributable, and the Visual C++ redistributable in one simple package.

= Known Issues =
== 64 Bit Support ==
While 64 bit is now a completely supported configuration, there is a glitch in the installation package. Visual Studio users may not see SlimDX as a reference that can be added in the .NET tab of the Add Reference dialog. They will need to browse to the install location and add the reference that way. ''This only affects developers.'' Users will not see any difference, and the assembly is still properly registered in and referenced from the Global Assembly Cache.
== XInput Support ==
The installer does not bundle an XInput driver, as it's unclear exactly how Microsoft intends for this package to be redistributed. Testing of the downloadable driver showed that it consistently failed to install, so it was omitted. If you are using XInput, your users may need to visit Microsoft Update in order to get a functional driver.

= Communication =
There are several different ways to get in touch with the SlimDX team:
  * We suggest that questions be posted to the [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/forum.asp?forum_id=10 DirectX forum] on GameDev.Net, as all of the SlimDX developers are regulars there. You may at your discretion prefix your thread title with [SlimDX].
  * If you believe you have found a bug, or you have a feature request, please enter it on this site under the [http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/issues/list Issues tab].
  * The developers are also typically available in the #gamedev and #graphicsdev IRC channels on AfterNET (irc.afternet.org).
  * You can email the developer list, slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com. This is *not* a recommended method of communicating with us, but may be used as a last ditch effort.
If you're interested in working on SlimDX itself, we would be glad to have the help. Send a private message to [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/viewprofile.asp?ID=19810 Promit] on the GameDev.Net forums or email slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com if you want to contribute.
