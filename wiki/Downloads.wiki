= Introduction =

The March 2008 release of SlimDX is now out. If you're new to this whole thing, read the [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started Getting Started] document on our wiki. It should help get you moving. Other pages of interest include:

= Remarks =

This release of SlimDX has been quite significantly refactored and redesigned. It's much nicer and smoother to use, and overall a vast improvement. There are tons of new features too; check the [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Release_Notes Release Notes] for details. Note that the March 2008 version of DirectX is necessary for this release. You can get it in one of two ways:

[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=572BE8A6-263A-4424-A7FE-69CFF1A5B180&displaylang=en DirectX SDK for March 2008] -- The full SDK, which is strongly recommended for anyone doing any DirectX work at all. A little under 450 MB in size.

[https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&displaylang=en DirectX End User Redistributable] -- This is all that's actually necessary for people to either develop using SlimDX or run SlimDX based applications. Size varies based on what you already have on your system.

If you *really* object to getting the March SDK, you can read [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Changing_SDK_Version this page] for instructions on compiling a custom SlimDX with a different SDK.

*There are major breaking changes in this version.* The object management model has been changed. This was not done lightly, and it was an unfortunate change, but it was better than the alternatives. Previously, SlimDX continuously spawned new instances of objects from functions like GetDevice, and it was necessary to manually dispose _every last one_. We felt that this was inconsistent with typical .NET programming style, and extremely error prone besides. Instead, starting from this March release, each distinct SlimDX object must only be disposed once. Functions like GetDevice will _not_ create a new instance, but will instead return a reference to the already existing reference. All of these references are kept in the ObjectTable class, which can be used to track leaked SlimDX objects. They are removed from the table when the object is disposed. It's also suggested that you enable Configuration.DetectDoubleDispose, as this will help catch bugs related to these changes.

We've added a prototype Sample Framework in this release, similar in basic spirit to the DXUT library. It's still in an early phase, and will be refined as we continue development. This library, like the rest of SlimDX, is under the MIT license and we encourage all of you to use as little or as much of it as you like.

= Known Issues =
== Debug Configuration ==
The Configuration class is supposed to change its values dynamically at runtime based on whether the DEBUG symbol has been defined. This does not work. It's suggested that you explicitly set the values of these options.
== 64 Bit Support ==
64 bit support is still not available in this version. We do expect to have it for the next release. Please contact us if you are willing to help develop the 64 bit version.
