#summary SlimDX -- March 2008 Release
= Introduction =

The March 2008 release of SlimDX is now out. If you're new to this whole thing, read the [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started Getting Started] document on our wiki. It should help get you moving. Other pages of interest include:

[http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page SlimDX Main Page] -- The front page of our wiki. This page makes it fairly straightforward to get to all of the other pages related to this project, both in the wiki and outside of it.

[http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Conventions Conventions] -- Describes the basic conventions used in SlimDX. Invaluable for understanding many of the basic decisions driving development.

[http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Debugging_Tips Debugging Tips] -- Tips on how to work on and debug applications using SlimDX. It's a really good idea to be familiar with the contents of this page, and check on it every so often, because it is updated periodically.

[http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Release_Notes Release Notes] -- In case you're curious about the details of what exactly has changed.

= Files to Download =
The following packages are available to download:

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20Samples%20%28Mar%2008%29.zip Samples] -- *Recommended!* Includes the SlimDX binaries, and all of the currently available samples.

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20%28Mar%2008%29.zip Binaries] -- Contains just the SlimDX binaries.

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX.chm Documentation] -- In CHM format. Still in the preliminary stages, but useful nonetheless.

[http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20Symbols%20%28Mar%2008%29.zip Debugging Symbols] -- Download if you know why you need them.

[http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/downloads/list?can=1 Older files] are still available, in case you have some need for them.

= Remarks =

This release of SlimDX has been quite significantly refactored and redesigned. It's much nicer and smoother to use, and overall a vast improvement. There are tons of new features too; check the [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Release_Notes Release Notes] for details. Note that the March 2008 version of DirectX is necessary for this release. You can get it in one of two ways:

[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=572BE8A6-263A-4424-A7FE-69CFF1A5B180&displaylang=en DirectX SDK for March 2008] -- The full SDK, which is strongly recommended for anyone doing any DirectX work at all. A little under 450 MB in size.

[https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&displaylang=en DirectX End User Redistributable] -- This is all that's actually necessary for people to either develop using SlimDX or run SlimDX based applications. Size varies based on what you already have on your system.

If you *really* object to getting the March SDK, you can read [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/wiki/index.php?title=Changing_SDK_Version this page] for instructions on compiling a custom SlimDX with a different SDK.

*There are major breaking changes in this version.* The object management model has been changed. This was not done lightly, and it was an unfortunate change, but it was better than the alternatives. Previously, SlimDX continuously spawned new instances of objects from functions like GetDevice, and it was necessary to manually dispose _every last one_. We felt that this was inconsistent with typical .NET programming style, and extremely error prone besides. Instead, starting from this March release, each distinct SlimDX object must only be disposed once. Functions like GetDevice will _not_ create a new instance, but will instead return a reference to the already existing reference. All of these references are kept in the ObjectTable class, which can be used to track leaked SlimDX objects. They are removed from the table when the object is disposed. It's also suggested that you enable Configuration.DetectDoubleDispose, as this will help catch bugs related to these changes.

We've added a prototype Sample Framework in this release, similar in basic spirit to the DXUT library. It's still in an early phase, and will be refined as we continue development. This library, like the rest of SlimDX, is under the MIT license and we encourage all of you to use as little or as much of it as you like.

= Known Issues =
== Debug Configuration ==
The Configuration class is supposed to change its values dynamically at runtime based on whether the DEBUG symbol has been defined. This does not work. It's suggested that you explicitly set the values of these options.
== 64 Bit Support ==
64 bit support is still not available in this version. We do expect to have it for the next release. Please contact us if you are willing to help develop the 64 bit version.

= Communication =
There are several different ways to get in touch with the SlimDX team:
  * We suggest that questions be posted to the [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/forum.asp?forum_id=10 DirectX forum] on GameDev.Net, as all of the SlimDX developers are regulars there. You may at your discretion prefix your thread title with [SlimDX].
  * If you believe you have found a bug, or you have a feature request, please enter it on this site under the [http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/issues/list Issues tab].
  * The developers are also typically available in the #gamedev and #graphicsdev IRC channels on AfterNET (irc.afternet.org).
  * You can email the developer list, slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com. This is *not* a recommended method of communicating with us, but may be used as a last ditch effort.

If you're interested in working on SlimDX itself, we would be glad to have the help. Send a private message to [http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/viewprofile.asp?ID=19810 Promit] on the GameDev.Net forums or email slimdx-devel@googlegroups.com if you want to contribute.
